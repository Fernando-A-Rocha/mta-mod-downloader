Mod Downloader (with GUI) for Multi Theft Auto: San Andreas:

- Highly customizable
- Translatable
- Robust
- Optimized
- Up to date

This system allows your players to control which replacement mods (skins, vehicles, objects/weapons) they want to download and use.

The following features are available:

- Resource settings to control everything
- Minimalistic CEGUI panel
- Alternative DGS panel (optional)
- Permissions system (per mod and to use the GUI)
- Teleportation system with GUI (example/demo)

This resource is intended for servers that want to give players the choice of which server replacement mods they can use (e.g. Freeroam/RPG/Drift/Racing servers).

Everything can be customized to your liking. See the sections below for more information.

### `mod_downloader` (Full Version)

Check [this README file](/.github/mod_downloader/README.md) for more information.

### `mod_downloader_simple` (Simplified Version)

This version simplifies model replacement. There is no GUI and it allows you to simply drag & drop your mods into the `mods_simple` folder of the `file_storage` resource. The mod files need to be named as follows:

- ID.txd (e.g. 400.txd)
- ID.dff (e.g. 400.dff)
- ID.col (e.g. 1337.col) - only for objects

See the [model IDs](/.github/MODEL_IDS.md) page for all vehicle, skin, weapon and object IDs.
