## Setup

**Installation** is very simple:

- Download the `mod_downloader` folder from the [latest release ZIP](https://github.com/Fernando-A-Rocha/mta-mod-downloader/releases/latest)
- Extract the folder to your MTA server's `resources` folder

There are demo mod files located in `mod_downloader/mods`. You can `start` the resource and type `/mods` to open the GUI!

To **customize** the resource, you can edit the `<settings>` in `meta.xml` manually.

You can also use the default MTA:SA `admin` resource's management panel to edit the settings.

Mods are defined in `meta.xml` under `<mods>`. Mods are organized in categories (each has a unique name) that will be displayed in the GUI.

The mod files need to exist in the server. This script is responsible for adding the `<file src='...'>` nodes to the meta.xml automatically, so you don't have to.

Each mod has the following attributes:

- `name` - The name of the mod (must be unique)
- `replace` - The ID that it will replace (e.g. 1 for skin 1)
- (optional) `dff` - The DFF file path (e.g. `mods/skin1.dff`)
- (optional) `txd` - The TXD file path (e.g. `mods/skin1.txd`)
- (optional) `col` - The COL file path (e.g. `mods/vendingmachine.col`), this is for objects
- (optional) `activated_by_default` - Whether the mod is activated by default (true/false)
- (optional) `encrypted` - Whether the mod is encrypted using [NandoCrypt](#NandoCrypt) (true/false)
- (optional) `permission_check` - The name of the serverside permission check function (e.g. `isPlayerAdmin(player)`)

## Demo Implementation

There is a [teleportation system](/mod_downloader/main/teleport_client.lua) included in the resource for demonstration purposes.

It could be useful for Freeroam/Drift servers. It allows you to define locations that players can teleport to, and require certain mods to be loaded in order to teleport to them.

You can code your own implementations using the functions and custom events available both client and server side.

## NandoCrypt

You can use [NandoCrypt (GitHub repository)](https://github.com/Fernando-A-Rocha/mta-nandocrypt) to encrypt your mods, then add the `encrypted` attribute to the mod in `meta.xml` and set it to `true`. This system will automatically decrypt the mod files when loading them. Don't forget that the `nando_decrypter` client script must be running, and you need to define the correct `decryption function name` in the resource settings.

The default setup comes with a few encrypted mods and a ready to use `nando_decrypter` client script.

## Reminders

- After adding one or more mods to the `<mods>` list or changing any of the `<settings>`, you must `restart` the resource for the changes to take effect.
- When deleting a mod from your server's filesystem that you will also remove from the resource's `<mods>` list, you must remove the mod's `<file src='...'>` nodes that can be found at the bottom of the `meta.xml` file. Otherwise, the resource won't load if it references files that don't exist.
- The `admin` settings editor doesn't update the `<settings>` in `meta.xml` when you save the settings. It actually saves the settings in the server's [settings registry](https://wiki.multitheftauto.com/wiki/Settings_system). So don't worry if you don't see the changes in `meta.xml` after saving the settings in the admin panel, MTA is loading the settings from the registry.

## GUI Customization

The GUI is fully customizable. You can change the colors, messages, etc. in the resource's `<settings>` in `meta.xml`.

Ontop of that, you can also use the `dgs` version of the GUI ([gui_client_dgs.lua](/mod_downloader/main/gui_client_dgs.lua)) which was created using [DGS version 3.519](https://github.com/thisdp/dgs/releases/tag/3.519) (a GUI library that uses dxDraw and is mostly compatible with the CEGUI functions). To do this, comment the `gui_client.lua` script node and uncomment the `gui_client_dgs.lua` one in `meta.xml`.

## Usage

Players can access the GUI by typing the command defined (default `/mods`) and/or the key bind defined (default none).

Players will only be able to access the panel if they have permission. This is defined in [permissions_server.lua (canPlayerOpenGUI(player))](/mod_downloader/main/permissions_server.lua).

Additional permissions can be defined in [permissions_server.lua (e.g. isPlayerAdmin(player))](/mod_downloader/main/permissions_server.lua). These functions can be referenced in each mod defined in `meta.xml`, and the player will only receive the mod if they have permission.
