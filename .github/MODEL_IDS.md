# Model IDs

This is an extensive list of all GTA:SA model IDs.

**Note**: Weapon IDs range from 1-46 and are not included here because they collide with Skin IDs.

⚠️ If you want to replace a weapon, use the weapon's object model ID. They are all [listed on this page](https://wiki.multitheftauto.com/wiki/Weapons).
